# Honey Coupon Fetcher
This script was made because of honey's [predatory practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4yL3YTwWk), and allows you to grab coupons from their API without having to use their extension

Script may not be perfect, it was made in less than 15 minutes but it works for now (as of 08/01/25)

## DISCLAIMER
this script was made mainly for **FUN** and practice purposes, if you're honey and want me to delete this, please reach out to me at [complaints@qjx.me](mailto:complaints@qjx.me) so we can resolve any issues
## Special thanks to
